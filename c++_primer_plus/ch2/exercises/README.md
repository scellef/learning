ch0201.cpp
Write a C++ program that displays your name and address

ch0202.cpp
Write a C++ program that asks for a distance in furlongs and converts it
to yards (One furlong is 220 yards).

ch0203.cpp
Write a C++ program that uses three user-defined functions (counting
main() as one) and produces the following output:

    Three blind mice
    Three blind mice
    See how they run
    See how they run

ch0204.cpp
Write a program that has main() call a user-defined function that takes
a Celsius temperature value as an argument and then returns the
equivalent Fahrenheit value.  The program should request the Celsuis
value as input from the user and display the result, as shown in the
following code:
    Please enter a Celsius value: 20
    20 degrees Celsius is 68 degrees Fahrenheit. 
For reference, here is the formula for making the conversion:
Fahrenheit = 1.8 * degrees Celsius + 32.0

ch0205.cpp
Write a program that has main() call a user-defined function that 
takes distance in light years as an argument and then returns the 
distance in astronomical units.  The program should request the light
year value as input from the user and display the result, as shown in
the following code:
    Enter the number of light years: 4.2
    4.2 light years = 265608 astronomical units
    1 light year = 63,240 astronomical units

ch0206.cpp
Write a program that asks the user to enter an hour value and a
minute value.  The main() function should then pass these two values
to a type void function that displays the two values in the format
shown in the following sample run:
    Enter the number of hours: 9
    Enter the number of minutes; 28
    Time: 9:28
